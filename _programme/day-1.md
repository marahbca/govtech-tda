      <h4>Rise of Human Operated Ransomware across Asia</h4>
      Avinash Lotke, Head of Security Solutions - APJ, Microsoft<br><br>
      Unlike commodity ransomware, which only requires malware remediation, human-operated ransomware is a significant and growing threat in most industries. These “hands-on-       keyboard” attacks leverage human attackers’ knowledge of system and security misconfigurations to infiltrate a network, adapting to the network and its weak points           along the way.

      <h4>It is a matter of when, NOT if.  Leadership lessons from managing response and recovery from cyber-attacks targeting public sector.</h4>
      Wilson Tan and Jim Fitzsimmons, Singtel Trustwave
      <br><br>
      Are you ready when your agency is hit with a cyber-attack? Agency leadership must be prepared for challenges much more complex than a simple technology incident. Beyond       the technical response of triage, investigation and remediation, a whole-of-organisation response is required to navigate the agency through the crisis.

      <h4>Cybersecurity Education: Evolving with the Times</h4>
      Vivek Ramachandran, Founder & CEO, Pentester Academy 
      <br><br>
      With almost all aspects of our lives now online, the virtual space is a lucrative target for hackers – yet cybersecurity professionals have been unable to up-skill          themselves in time. This talk explores the core challenges of cybersecurity education and how organisations can better prepare themselves against cyber-threats.
