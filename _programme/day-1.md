      <h4>Rise of Human Operated Ransomware across Asia</h4>
      <em>Abbas Kudrati,Chief Cybersecurity Advisor, Security Solutions Area, Microsoft</em>
      <br><br>
      Unlike commodity ransomware, which only requires malware remediation, human-operated ransomware is a significant and growing threat in most industries. These “hands-on-keyboard” attacks leverage human attackers’ knowledge of system and security misconfigurations to infiltrate a network, adapting to the network and its weak points along the way.

      <h4>It is a matter of when, NOT if.  Leadership lessons in managing cyber-attacks.</h4>
      <em>Wilson Tan, Director, Trustwave and Jim Fitzsimmons, Director, Control Risks</em>
      <br><br>
      Are you ready when your agency is hit with a cyber-attack? Agency leadership must be prepared for challenges much more complex than a simple technology incident. Beyond       the technical response of triage, investigation and remediation, a whole-of-organisation response is required to navigate the agency through the crisis.

      <br><br>
      With almost all aspects of our lives now online, the virtual space is a lucrative target for hackers – yet cybersecurity professionals have been unable to up-skill          themselves in time.
