      <h4>Observability And Recovery In The Cloud</h4>
      <em>Aditi Agarwal, Senior Software Development Consultant, ThoughtWorks</em>
      <br><br>
      A major benefit of going cloud-native is that systems are able to respond to problems in near real-time. This session covers topics including the difference between observability and monitoring, how to pick observability targets, and how to design systems that can find and handle unknown unknowns.

      <h4>MLOps: DevOps for Machine Learning Project</h4>
      <em>Marcus Tee, Solutions Architect, Microsoft</em>
      <br><br>
      MLOps – the coming together of Machine Learning and DevOps – is gaining popularity as it bridges the gap between data scientists and application developers. But often, organisations face challenges in preserving an audit trail for ML algorithm training processes, and in deploying ML algorithms in an automated and scalable manner.

      <h4>Confidential Computing Technology</h4>
      <em>Ang Teck Leong, Cloud Consultant, GovTech</em>
      <br><br>
      In confidential computing, sensitive data is isolated in a protected CPU enclave during processing. The contents of the enclave – comprising the data being processed and the techniques used to process it – are accessible only to authorised programming code and invisible and unknowable to anything/anyone else, including the cloud provider.
