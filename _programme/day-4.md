      <h4>eXplainable AI (XAI) and AI Ethics</h4>
      <em>Dr Tian Jing, Senior Lecturer & Consultant, Artificial Intelligence Practice, NUS-ISS</em>
      <br><br>
      Modern AI systems are becoming a vital component of our modern world, due to their increasing capabilities of handling real-life challenges. However, the black box nature of some AI systems, which produce outcomes without explanation, is hindering the widespread adoption of AI. We need to understand why and how it makes predictions and decisions. This talk consists of two parts. The first part provides a brief explanation of XAI and its usages in video surveillance and finance industry. The second part provides an overview of AI Ethics in relation to AI model development and usage.
