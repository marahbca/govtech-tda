      <h4>Transformating from a project to product-centric organisation</h4>
      <em>Kendrick Lee, Director (Trusted Data & Services), GovTech and Daniel Boey, Chief, Digital Products & Platforms Practice, NUS-ISS</em>
      <br><br>
      The benefits of embracing digital extend beyond building digital products such as phone applications and digital platforms to better engage citizens/employees. We strive to improve productivity, speed and build closer intimacy with our stakeholders. In the process we also hope to transform our organisations’ culture to achieve agility, customer centricity and cultivate a spirit of risk-taking and innovation! 
What is the best way to deliver all these, yet ensure we meet the organisational goals and expected outcomes with a reasonable budget? Join us in the webinar to learn how a product-centric delivery model can help.

      <h4>Learning with small data: Few-shot learning</h4>
      <em>Tan Jen Hong, Lecturer & Consultant, Artificial Intelligence Practice, NUS-ISS</em>
      <br><br>
      Humans can recognise new object classes from very few instances. However, most machine learning techniques require thousands of examples to achieve similar performance.       The goal of few-shot learning is to classify new data having seen only a few training examples. In this talk, we are going to take a look what is few-shot learning, and       what are the solutions available in literature to solve this type of problem.

      <h4>eXplainable AI (XAI) and AI Ethics</h4>
      <em>Tian Jing, Senior Lecturer & Consultant, Artificial Intelligence Practice, NUS-ISS</em>
      <br><br>
      Modern AI systems are becoming a vital component of our modern world, due to their increasing capabilities of handling real-life challenges. However, the black box nature of some AI systems, which produce outcomes without explanation, is hindering the widespread adoption of AI. We need to understand why and how it makes predictions and decisions. This talk consists of two parts. The first part provides a brief explanation of XAI and its usages in video surveillance and finance industry. The second part provides an overview of AI Ethics in relation to AI model development and usage.

      <h4>Data Transformation Is At The Heart Of Digitalisation</h4>
      <em> Joseph Tan, Assistant Director, Capability Development, GovTech </em>
      <br><br>
       Organisations, public or private, around the world are accelerating their digitalisation efforts, more so due to COVID-19. At the heart of digital transformation is data transformation. Done well, the transformation efforts will supercharge the effectiveness of the entire organisation as leaders and staff embrace the use of data, and incorporate data science and AI into workflows, products and operations.
The talk highlights the suite of capability development initiatives that are running to help agencies drive their own data transformation efforts. From frameworks & guides, training and masterclasses, to community building meetups, campaigns and hackathons, learn how you can easily be a part of them – either as a participant, an advocate, or leverage these initiatives for your own internal data transformation needs. You will also hear about how we’re walking the talk in leveraging these initiatives to drive data transformation within GovTech and evolve ourselves into a data analytics ready organisation.
