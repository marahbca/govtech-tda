        <em>Co-Founder,Change Voyage</em>
        <br>
        <p>Dr YONG Hsin Ning is the co-founder of Change Voyage Consulting and an award-winning educator at the Singapore Management University.
Dr Yongâ€™s passion is to solve ambiguously defined problems and to decipher human behaviour in organisations. Her passion drove her to spend more than 15 years working in Accenture, a top-tier global consultancy firm.  In the public service sector, she has worked with clients in the areas of Defense, Education, Revenue, Industrial Relations, Employment Services and Social Services.  In the private sector, she has served clients across the Oilfield Services, Consumer Goods, Telecommunications and Airline industries. <br>
Through her engagements with these organisations, she found that many were unprepared to continue managing the change after the technologies were put in place.  They also did not know how to develop the capabilities to do so.  <br>
This gap inspired her entrepreneurship adventure, Change Voyage Consulting.  This boutique consulting company was set up in 2017 to help companies develop change capabilities so that they can harness the maximum benefits from the transformation. <br>        
Dr Yong holds a PhD in Business (General Management) at the Singapore Management University, a Masterâ€™s degree in Commerce from the University of New South Wales and a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Accountancy from the Nanyang Technological University.</p>
