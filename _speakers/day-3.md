    <em>Director, Digital Design & Development, GovTech</em>
    <br><br>
    <p>Eyung Lim has been instrumental in shaping the digital service delivery landscape. He envisioned and spearheaded the Digital Experience Design (DXD) Sandbox, to help government agencies in adopting data-driven and design-based approaches in their digital endeavours. Since its inception in October 2015, Eyung and his team have worked on key government projects such as IRAS MyTax Portal, HDB Resale Portal, MSO OneService, Moments of Life and many more. Eyung is a firm believer and practitioner of the “golden triangle” of product strategies, design and engineering excellence as the critical success factors in any product implementation.<br>
Eyung is also a key driver of whole-of-government (WOG) projects & programmes that radically change the way government engages and interacts with citizens. This includes the implementation of the Whole-of-Government Application Analytics platform which is part of Singapore Government Tech Stack as well as the Service Journey approach which fundamentally streamlines offerings across government agencies around citizen life stages and needs.<br>
As a data researcher by training, he strongly advocates the use of data in guiding better design and engineering excellence. Two such initiatives are A/B Testing during National Day Rally as well as time optimisation for the end-to-end continuous integration & development in agile development process. Eyung and his team also proposed and implemented the Experience-to-Emotion mapping to better understand how user experience drives user behaviour differently.</p>

        <em>Co-Founder,Change Voyage</em>
        <br><br>
        <p>Dr YONG Hsin Ning is the co-founder of Change Voyage Consulting and an award-winning educator at the Singapore Management University. She has been awarded the Dean’s Teaching Honour List - Top Adjunct Faculty between 2019 – 2021 in recognition for her excellent teaching performance.<br>
Dr Yong’s passion is to solve ambiguously defined problems and to decipher human behaviour in organisations. Her passion drove her to spend more than 15 years working in Accenture, a top-tier global consultancy firm.  In the public service sector, she has worked with clients in the areas of Defense, Education, Revenue, Industrial Relations, Employment Services and Social Services.  In the private sector, she has served clients across the Oilfield Services, Consumer Goods, Telecommunications and Airline industries.  <br>
Through her engagements with these organisations, she found that many were unprepared to continue managing the change after the technologies were put in place.  They also did not know how to develop the capabilities to do so.  <br>
This gap inspired her entrepreneurship adventure, Change Voyage Consulting.  This boutique consulting company was set up in 2017 to help companies develop change capabilities so that they can harness the maximum benefits from the transformation.  <br>
Dr Yong holds a PhD in Business (General Management) at the Singapore Management University, a Master’s degree in Commerce from the University of New South Wales and a Bachelor’s degree in Accountancy from the Nanyang Technological University.
