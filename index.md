# Be At The Intersection of Technology and Public Service
Join us for a week-long immersive learning experience and get a taster of courses that will be delivered at The Digital Academy!
We have lined up a series of talks which are engaging and interactive, to nurture the joy of learning.  An e-exhibition will showcase projects from GovTech, to demonstrate their functional clusters' capabilities to tackle challenges with the use of technology and innovation.
Following the soft launch in Jan 2021 to GovTech and SNDGO, the Launch Symposium and Learning Festival will now extend its reach to a wider audience from WoG - Public Service Leaders, ICT professionals and Public Service Officers. With a variety of tech domains to choose from, there is something for everyone at the Learning Festival.
